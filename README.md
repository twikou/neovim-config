# personal neovim config

## requirement

- Nerdfont
- fd, ripgrep, fzf

## some counter-intuitive keymap
because of my short finger, i feel hard to type `$` and `^` key (`<shift-4>` and `<shift-6>`), so i change keymap as below:
- `L` instead of `$` (neovim default `L` is jump to bottom of window)
- `H` instead of `^` (neovim default `H` is jump to top of window)

`S` key will not put text to register, only clear line, indent and go to insert mode (why not just `cc`?)
